== Configuration

MicroProfile OpenTracing project leverages MicroProfile Config specification to provide a consistent means for
all supported configuration options. It means that vendor implementations must also be compliant with
the Config specification.

All configuration keys supported by this project start with `mp.opentracing`. Refer to the Config
specification for precedence of config sources and replacement of illegal characters such as
`.` and `-` to `_` when using environmental variables.
