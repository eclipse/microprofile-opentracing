=== Release 3.0

==== Incompatible changes

==== Incompatible changes

===== Update OpenTracing API to 0.33.0 (https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/pull/177[#177])

The following APIs were removed:

* `Scope = ScopeManager.activate(Span, boolean)`: no alternative auto-finishing has been removed.
* `Span = Scope.span()`: use `ScopeManager.activeSpan()` or hold the reference to `Span` explicitly since the span was started.
* `Scope =SpanBuilder.startActive()`: use `Tracer.activateSpan(Span)` instead.
* `Span = Tracer.startManual()`: use `Tracer.start()` instead.
* `AutoFinishScopeManager`: no alternative, auto-finishing has been removed.
