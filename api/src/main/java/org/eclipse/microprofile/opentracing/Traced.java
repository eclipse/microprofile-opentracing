/**
 * This annotation allows fine-tuned control over which classes and methods create OpenTracing spans. By default, all
 * JAX-RS methods implicitly have this annotation.
 *
 * This annotation applies to a class or a method. When applied to a class, this annotation is applied to all methods of
 * the class. If the annotation is applied to a class and method then the annotation applied to the method takes
 * precedence. The annotation starts a Span at the beginning of the method, and finishes the Span at the end of the
 * method.
 *
 * This annotation also has {@code InterceptorBinding} for frameworks to process all of each application's explicit
 * {@code Traced} annotations.
