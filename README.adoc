# Microprofile OpenTracing

The Microprofile Opentracing specification defines behaviors and an API for accessing an OpenTracing compliant Tracer object within your JAX-RS application.
The behaviors specify how incoming and outgoing requests will have OpenTracing Spans automatically created. The API defines how to explicitly access a configured Tracer object.
