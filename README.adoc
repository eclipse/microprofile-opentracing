# MicroProfile OpenTracing

The Microprofile Opentracing specification defines behaviors and an API for accessing
an OpenTracing compliant Tracer object within your JAX-RS application.
The behaviors specify how incoming and outgoing requests will have OpenTracing
Spans automatically created. The API defines how to explicitly disable or enable
tracing for given endpoints.

* For the current specification see link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-opentracing.asciidoc[microprofile-opentracing-spec].
